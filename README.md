Answer to TheOdinProject's Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Guided Steps

- [ ] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
- [x] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
- [x] Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker.
- [x] Set up HTML and JS to render the contents of the gameboard.
- [x] Store the `gameboard, player, gameFlow` as objects. _gameboard_ could be an array inside of a `Gameboard` object.
